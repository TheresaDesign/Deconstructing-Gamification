    </div>
    <article class="text-center">
      <p>Insights and Critique Duolingo’s innovative approach to language learning rests on the principles of gamification, operant conditioning, the dopamine reward system, and the flow theory movement. However, grasping the concept of its effectiveness, language acquisition, entertainment, which barriers are languages and fun, and earning ethically are evaluated.
      </p>
      <h3>Influence of Learning new Languages/Education</h3>
      <p>Usage of Duolingo is supposed to be helpful in not just developing reading aspects but also general vocabulary in them. It was concluded by <a id="source" href="">Loewen et al. (2019)</a> that students who use Duolingo are able to perform at a level equated by most authorities to first-year university students enrolled in traditional language courses. However, these students primarily have language competencies in receptive skills, vocabulary and grammar.</p>
      <p>Тhe main point is that Duolingo makes use of very strong systematic and repetitive approaches, and it design this way to support the idea of memorization. Gabriel Wyner, in his book Fluent Forever, states that these two factors are necessary and critical. These strategies are incorporated partially into Duolingo but can be improved to include more cultural and linguistic contexts</p>
      <h3>The Fine Line Between Fun and Work</h3>
      <p>Duolingo has in-built certain characteristics that allow one to overwhelm the dangers of free-style or self-led learning. A great way to encourage learners is through gamification of learning, which is something Duolingo is great at. To reward them for their engagement, they were provided with XP, sprees and leaderboards. This moves the entire idea of education closer to the edge. Most studies indicate, that the retention rate of the learning can increase by about forty percent due to the instant feedback reinstating memory networks.</p>
      <p>Games like Duolingo, however, provide too much entertainment for their substance and real-world constructs. What then ends up writing over instructional engagement, is spending too much time on gaming the shot at the sprees. Javlon’s improvement in the educational scope of the app may come through incorporating qualitative exercises while withholding trivial ones, such as making requests through language systems that are unable to communicate.</p>
      <h3>Design Considerations for Accessibility and Inclusivity</h3>
      <p>The free tier of the Duolingo application is a good starting point in making language education available to neglected groups around the world. The mobile first approach also allows use for people in areas with little formal education</p>
      <p>There are however some obstacles that still remain. Studies focused on usability themselves reveal the barriers associated with limited or no basic digital literacy among some individuals with disabilities. Also, visually or aurally disabled learners might not benefit from using Duolingo as it is so much text heavy. There could be solutions or interfaces that allow such individuals to interact with the application effectively.</p>
      <h3>Ethical Issues Surrounding Monetization</h3>
      <p>Duolingo's freemium model poses certain ethical dilemmas. It is good that there is free content, but the presence of advertisements renders the learning experience disjointed. A subscription removes adverts, allows for offline use, and provides unlimited hearts. This creates a two (2)-sided inequality and disadvantages economically poor people</p>
      <p>Other game mechanics include the loss of already earned streaks and high placement in competitive leagues creates competition and pressure which can lead to overspending to access premium features. Transparency about the price and the absence of intrusiveness ads and moderation of monetization targets would however be ethical.</p>
      <h3>conclusion</h3>
      <p>Getting Duolingo was a significant game-changer to the ability of language learning to be globalized. The game-like structure of the application adds fun and ease in the tough task of learning a new language.</p>
      <p>However, to become more effective in the long run the app has to achieve a better mix of fun and education, expand its inclusivity measures, and come up with acceptable ways of monetizing the app. Overcoming these restrictions, Duolingo will be able to recreate itself as a professional learning application.</p>
