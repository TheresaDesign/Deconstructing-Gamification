                    <p>Gamification is highly effective across various domains because it activates a wide range of psychological mechanisms. By breaking down information into smaller, manageable pieces, it becomes easier to process. Learning content is made more engaging, and knowledge retention is enhanced through immediate feedback. <span class="source" onclick="togglePopup()">Studies show <sup>2</sup></span> that gamification in educational applications can improve memory performance by up to 40%.</p>
                    <p>Let us now examine the principles behind gamification and the game elements through which they are applied.</p>

                <h3>Psychological principles</h3>
                <article>
                    In the following, we will introduce you to four psychological principles that are used in gamification:

                    <p id="bold">Operant conditioning</p>
                    <p>Here, a certain behavior is encouraged or suppressed by working with rewards or punishments. This form of conditioning can be found in Duolingo in the form of streaks, rewards after completing a task, completing quests or badges, advancement in leagues, etc. Operant conditioning is one of the methods most commonly used by Duolingo.</p>
                    <p>In principle, conditioning can also go in the negative direction, which is admittedly used less frequently in gamification, as there is a risk of reduced engagement. The removal of aversive states (a state that is perceived as unpleasant and that you want to avoid or end) could be seen as a kind of middle ground. Punishment is too harsh in its execution and could demotivate the user too much. The aversive states, on the other hand, work with negative reinforcement. This feeling can be found, for example, when the user is afraid of losing their streak, losing their place in the league or when the level time is running out.</p>
