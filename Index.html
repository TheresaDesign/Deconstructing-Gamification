        In principle, conditioning can also go in the negative direction, which is admittedly used less frequently in gamification, as there is a risk of reduced engagement. The removal of aversive states (a state that is perceived as unpleasant and that you want to avoid or end) could be seen as a kind of middle ground. Punishment is too harsh in its execution and could demotivate the user too much. The aversive states1, on the other hand, work with negative reinforcement. This feeling can be found, for example, when the user is afraid of losing their streak, losing their place in the league or when the level time is running out.
